# LogoGAN

This project is largely based on the Coursera guided project: ["Generate Synthetic Images with DCGANs in Keras"](https://www.coursera.org/projects/generative-adversarial-networks-keras). Using the Tensorflow Keras API, this is a Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) model implementation for generating new logo designs. 

## Dataset
The model was trained on the **Large Logo Dataset**. The dataset can be obtained from the following link: https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/sagea/lld/
